## Description

This demo showcases the core functionality of WebStencils in a FireMonkey (FMX) application through a highly visual interface. The templates are stored as global constants in a dedicated unit, while the `TPerson` class resides in its own separate unit.

The main form has been designed to adapt easily to any Desktop screen size (not ready for mobile yet). 

## How to Run

No additional configuration is required. Simply execute the program to get started.

> **Note:** This demo is compatible with all FMX platforms.

## Visual Styles

To achieve a more modern aesthetic, this demo utilizes the Impressive Dark FMX Template, which can be downloaded from GetIt (Enterprise edition or higher).
